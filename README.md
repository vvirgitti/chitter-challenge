###CheetR Challenge

Makers Academy Week 4 Challenge.
Try it out here: CheetR Challenge

####Concept:

This is my version of Twitter, renamed Cheet-R! Users can sign up, log in and log out. They can post their cheets and see them on their timeline in reverse chronological order (i.e the most recent ones on top).

####Build with:

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Postgresql
- Datamapper
- BCrypt
- HTML5
- CSS
- Tested with Rspec

####Features:

- User sign up with email, password, name and username
- Username and email are unique
- Cheets display the name of the user and their username
- Secured passwords via Bcrypt
- Cheets can't be seen without being logged in but to post a cheet, user has to be logged in 

####Future iterations:
- More elegant front-end design
- Allow users to reply to other users' cheets
